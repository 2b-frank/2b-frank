  <p align="center"><strong>I don't like 99.9% of the fandoms I'm technically a part of. If I don't acknowledge you approaching me, that's most likely why. Most of the time I just hang out with my friends in skins of characters I like, and have no interest in interacting with fandom mates.</strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>If you for some reason care about my fiction discourse stance: IDGAF what your tastes are, bullying people is bad. I'm employed and live under heavy censorship and technically a criminal for the fact of being gay btw.</strong></p>
